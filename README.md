# Library
library 

I created this app as an exercise project for The Odin Project to keep track of my book reading progress. I decided to use a JSON DB server as a database for book items. I coded it in TypeScript since I am interested in this language and plan to use it for my future projects. That's why I decided to make use of my fresh TypeScript knowledge in this project to consolidate it as a stonger  neuronal connection.
